# Purpose
***
The purpose of this repo is to store my personal notes while taking the ["Data Analysis with Polars"](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-with-polars/) course from Udemy, by Liam Brannigan.
# Setup
***
If you want to set up a conda environment identical to the one I used while running the code from this course, you can create one by running:
```
make conda_env
```

This will generate a conda environment with the name of `udemy_polars_env`
